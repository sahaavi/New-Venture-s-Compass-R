New Venture(s) Compass - Team Work Contract
==================

A team work contract outlines the logistics of working together and sets expectations for each team member. It governs your working relationship and can help manage and resolve issues that arise. Below are some key aspects of our team work contract:

-   We will aim to distribute work fairly and equitably among team members.
-   We will expect nothing but the best and hold each other accountable to the highest standards.
-   We will work for 5-10 hours per person per week.
-   We will have meetings twice a week.
-   We will use agile standards for our style of working.
-   There are no general constraints for availability.

This contract represents the principles we adhere to when working together. It should only be updated if there is agreement between all team members to do so.

By adhering to this team work contract, we hope to improve our teamwork, communication, leadership, and organizational skills, which will be beneficial not just for this project, but also for our future endeavors.
